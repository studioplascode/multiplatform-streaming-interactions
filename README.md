<h1 align="center">Multiplatform-Streaming-Interactions</h1>

Streaming has been closed source for too long. I am baffled that there are still no good solutions for things like Multiplatform-Chat, On-Stream Alerts and Notifications and everything else you've come to expect from the giants of the industry.

Thus, I wanna build a tool to do exactly that.

## What this project is meant to be:

This project is meant to become an easy to use, user-friendly tool that should be as close to know streaming-solutions as possible. Everything should be customizable. And everything should be open source.

## What it is right now

Nothing, to be quite honest. I've only started working on it. But I am highly motivated and I'm having a lot of fun making it. Let's hope it'll be useful to many in the future.
